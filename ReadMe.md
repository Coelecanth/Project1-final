## Strategy

### Site Goals

    This particular project is to design and create a static website that is done mainly through HTML and CSS., and use supporting code libraries such as Bootstrap. 

    The main goal for the website is to get potential customers to engage and then book a visit to the wilderness Lodge of Alaska Fly fishing, by impressing upon on them them the following: 
    - The unique wilderness
    - The excellent fly fishing avialable to them
    - Remove as much duress - show how Alaska fly fishing, takes away the complexity and uncertainiy of getting to the destination   
    - Be able to stay there in a high levelof  comfort  
    - Encouraging the visior to get in contact or stay in contact through subscribing to the news letter . 

    The site from the first landing point will need to be appealing in design so that it appeals to users giving a pleasing out come and thus standing out. This then encourages the user to want to further explore the site. By making the site fully responsive to different screen sizes (basically there are 3 disiticnt screen sizes) with a single page scroll and navigation bar fixed and visible at all times, the site aims to be easily accessible no matter which platform the user is viewing the site on.

    The sites goal of "luxury service and accomdation in the wilderness" means that the user gets the right sense that this is a high quality lodge with well established history, but also a friendly family owned and run business, which works with the local native communities and leaves little or no impact on the envioronment.   
    To establish the site provides high quality images applealing to the fly fisher. This will reinforce the goals and overall impression of a duress free visit with some excelleennt fly fishing staying in luxury accomadation. 
## Skeleton

To create the wireframes which are an initial outlay of the layout of the site. There were three frames created. Each frame representing a different device and each frame measured in pixels. This was done to show the responsiveness of the layout on different devices.

Desktop (1920 x 1080)
Tablet (1024 x 1366)
Mobile (393 x 852)
Wireframes

The wireframes were then built on by creating an actual fully designed site using the colour palette, fonts and images that were selected when initially scoping out the site. Planning and being as prepared as possible was the key reason for generating the full designs using figma.

Having the design already laid out with the bulk of the main elements, like which colours work well together, which elements were coloured what, which font to use for what text, which images to use and where they are placed, having all these factors planned out makes the coding of the site easier to focus on and more straightforward.##

# Design

The design of the site should be friendly adopting an inviting feeling based on the family business, but also provide imagery and text to make th website appealling and stand out from the crowd in terms of other websites within the same industry. 
A colour palette was chosen thats reflect a forest like feel with suitable greens and browns. 
The fonts selected were slected to creat a relaxed feel with good contrast.

## Colour scheme

    The colours within the chosen palette were chosen to provide a sympathetic colour represnrting the the typical colours found in a destination based in the Pacific north west forest region. Tints and Shades of these colours used are predominatly greens and browns with some leaning to blue. They were chosen using the site coolors.co located here 
https://coolors.co/002d00-2a2600-77bfa3-98c9a3-bfd8bd.

## Typography
Fonts I used  were chosen from Fontjoy.com which provides a mechanism to mix and match together fonts to provide aestically pleasing results. 
The following 3 fonts were chosen to provide good contrast in styles to each other and be symapthetic with the site and its function 

- Great Vibes - a script like font used in all the main titles, as suggested in fontjoy 
- Radley - used to provide contrast in all other heading as suggested in fontjoy 
- Karma - used throughtour in the body as suggested in fontjoy 

The Karma font is the main font used throughout the whole website used in the body test of pages. 
With Sans Serif as the fallback font (in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly). 
Karma is a clean font and differntitates strongly in compairison with great Vibes and is more complimnetary to Radley  

The Radley font is used throughout for heading in the page to provide moderate contrast to Karma
 and Highlight against XXX 
the weight of the font was chosedn to be heavier to give a more bold appreance for headings .also used for Copyright

An additiona font of Great Vibes is used in the hero banner to create a less formal feel to the website, with a backup font of cursive. 
The font is a script like font and works well in larger sizes   

All fonts were sourced and referebved from google fonts and imported in style.css 

## Icons

    The icons used are all found at Font Awesome. Having icons as the social media links immediately allows the user to easily identify which social media platform is which. The icons on the footer used to identify the opening hours, address and telephone numbers are all easily appealing on the eye for the user.
    Features
    Navigation Bar
    Screenshots


## Images

The images have been chosen to reflect the destination with pictures of fly fishing and fish, and the expereince of the wilderness. 
the images were sourced from: 
 - Istock https://www.istockphoto.com/
 - From my personal picture collection


## Homepage

This will offer a stand out navigation bar that will be fixed to bottom of the page so when scrolling through the site the user at any point can skip or go back to certain sections on the page. The hero image will be a backdrop flyfishing will which will be symaptehtic to the colour scheem 
the image will be sized to balace between good and performance and high quality/defintion, so that we make sure load times on smaller devices are kept as low as possible and that we don't use too much of the users data.

## FAQ page 

We will use warm neutral colours with this section that will ultimately give the user a small but informative insight into the business, who we are, where we operate and what we offer.

## Enquiry/newsletter form 

## Design Feature Elements 

### Footer/Navbar 

    The footer will be fixed so as to allow user to browse regardless of where they on the page or site 
    Contact

    This will be where the user inputs there relevant information where they will be able to get in touch with the company. 
    It will also contain a map indicating where the company is actually located.


    The structure of the site consists of a single scrollable page rather than multiple separate pages. This should give a more accessible experience for all and by doing so will adopt a more mobile-first design which although market reserach for this business given the demographic and age of people, suggest a preference to use larget screen devices this provides better interest to  keep the user interested 

    
### Hero Header

    The hero has a full width fixed image which has text that is fixed over it and darker tranapetn bar to add impact. 
    The image is responsive, targeting the main part of the image when it scales down. 
    the image was souced from Istock 
    
    The user is introduced to the company and visiting the lodge with an image of a very enigmatic scene. The image really captures the essence of the fly fisher in being in an unspolit wilderness flishing, Transapernt bar helps to provide contrast but stops the image being broken up.
   

## About Us
## Screenshots

    The about us section is a simple layout which features the section header, a few paragraphs of text and the button that links to the contact section.

    The user will be given a brief introduction as to who the company are, what they can expect from the company and allow them to go straight to the contact section of the page.

# Testing Issues and Resolution

### Slow rendering performance - index.html
So when testing with lighthouse in the chrome browser I was getting consistenly slow download score  


 - I changed all the images in the page to avif from jpg to reduce there size, and re-run the tests and it was still slow to render (not load). This removed any possible connection with file format or size. 
 - Having researched this as to what causes a rendering of 5 secs in the browser, the explanation is that image format and size is not really the issue. 
 - It was bootstrap grid setting I have set of “container-fluid” which forces the browser to cover the whole width page of the row, in this case the image covers the whole row. 
 - This causes the image to be resized excessively by the browser, 
   - Once I removed "fluid" element as a test, the reduction in render was immediatte and worked with massive reduction in rendering to approx. 1000 ms (previous was 5000 ms). 
 - So now realising what the issue is, as to why the browser is taking too long to resize this image, because it has to be stretched across a row. 
 - I realised that the image needs to be made bigger in its pixel count from 700 to 1400px. To reduce the effort by the browser to resize. 
 - Having changed the image to this pixel count and saved as an Avif. I have acceptable performance. E.g. we can make 90% (Green) in lighthouse. 
    - But this is a tricky balancing act; as making the image larger in pixel count makes it easier to render but longer to down load so careful testing and experimenatation were conducted to strike a good balance
