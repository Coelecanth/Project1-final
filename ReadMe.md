## Strategy

### Site Goals

    This particular project is to design and create a static website that is done mainly through HTML and CSS., and use supporting code libraries such as Bootstrap. 

    The main goal for the website is to get potential customers to engage and then book a visit to the wilderness Lodge of Alaska Fly fishing, by impressing upon on them them the following: 
    - The unique wilderness
    - the excellent fly fishing avialable to them
    - Remove as much duress - show how Alaska fly fishing, takes away the complexity and uncertainiy of getting to the destination   
    - Be able to stay there in a high levelof  comfort  
    - Encouraging the visior to get in contact or stay in contact through subscribing to the news letter . 

    The site from the first landing point will need to be appealing in design so that it appeals to users giving a pleasing out come and thus standing out. This then encourages the user to want to further explore the site. By making the site fully responsive to different screen sizes (basically there are 3 disiticnt screen sizes) with a single page scroll and navigation bar fixed and visible at all times, the site aims to be easily accessible no matter which platform the user is viewing the site on.

    The sites goal of "luxury service and accomdation in the wilderness" means that the user gets the right sense that this is a high quality lodge with well established history, but also a friendly family owned and run business, which works with the local native communities and leaves little or no impact on the envioronment.   
    To establish the site provides high quality images applealing to the fly fisher. This will reinforce the goals and overall impression of a duress free visit with some excelleennt fly fishing staying in luxury accomadation. 


### Scope

The main features that will be implemented into the website will be included in 
navigated via a single scrollable page.

The design of the site should be friendly adopting an inviting feeling based on teh family business, but also be provide imagery and text to make th website applealing and stand out from the crowd in terms of other websites within the same industry. 
A colour palette was chosen thats reflect a forest like feel with suitable greens and browns 
The fonts selected at this point to help create this design.

### Homepage

This will offer a stand out navigation bar that will be fixed to bottom of the page so when scrolling through the site the user at any point can skip or go back to certain sections on the page. The hero image will be a backdrop flyfishing will which will be symaptehtic to the colour scheem 
the image will be sized to balace between good and performance and high quality/defintion, so that we make sure load times on smaller devices are kept as low as possible and that we don't use too much of the users data.

### FAQ page 

We will use warm neutral colours with this section that will ultimately give the user a small but informative insight into the business, who we are, where we operate and what we offer.

### Enquiry/newsletter form 




### Footer

    The footer will be fixed so as to allow user to browse regardless of where they on the page or site 
    Contact

    This will be where the user inputs there relevant information where they will be able to get in touch with the company. 
    It will also contain a map indicating where the company is actually located.


    The structure of the site consists of a single scrollable page rather than multiple separate pages. This should give a more accessible experience for all and by doing so will adopt a more mobile-first design which although market reserach for this business given the demographic and age of people, suggest a preference to use larget screen devices 
    this provides better interest to  keep the user interested 




## Colour scheme

    The colours within the chosen palette were chosen to provide a sympathetic colour represnrting the the typical colours found in a destination based in the Pacific north west forest region. Tints and Shades of these colours used are predominatly greens and browns with some leaning to blue. They were chosen using the site coolors.co located here

### Typography

    The font Poppins was chosen for the headers and the text that required more prominence. To find a font that would be used for the main body of the text was done via an online pairing tool called fontpair.co. Both these fonts are available at Google Fonts.

# Images

The images have been chosen 

# Icons

    The icons used are all found at Font Awesome. Having icons as the social media links immediately allows the user to easily identify which social media platform is which. The icons on the footer used to identify the opening hours, address and telephone numbers are all easily appealing on the eye for the user.

## Hero
## Screenshots

    The hero has a full width fixed image which has text that is fixed over it and darker tranapetn bar to add impact. 
    The image is responsive, targeting the main part of the image when it scales down. 
    the image was souced from Istock 
    
    The user is introduced to the company and visiting the lodge with an image of a very enigmatic scene. The image really captures the essence of the fly fisher in being in an unspolit wilderness flishing, Transapernt bar helps to provide contrast but stops the image being broken up.
